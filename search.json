    "text": "Introduction and Getting Started\nToday, we’re going to use python to construct an interesting data visualization of the Palmer Penguins dataset. You can read the data into python by running the following code:\n\nimport pandas as pd\nurl = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pic16b-ucla/24W/main/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv\"\npenguins = pd.read_csv(url)\n\nAdditionally, we’re going to want to import both seaborn and matplotlib to create our plots. To do this, run the following code.\n\nimport seaborn as sns \nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the Dataset\nNow let’s take a look at the dataset. To get an idea of what it looks like, let’s inspect the first five rows of our penguins DataFrame, using the .head() function as seen below.\n\npenguins.head(5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstudyName\nSample Number\nSpecies\nRegion\nIsland\nStage\nIndividual ID\nClutch Completion\nDate Egg\nCulmen Length (mm)\nCulmen Depth (mm)\nFlipper Length (mm)\nBody Mass (g)\nSex\nDelta 15 N (o/oo)\nDelta 13 C (o/oo)\nComments\n\n\n\n\n0\nPAL0708\n1\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN1A1\nYes\n11/11/07\n39.1\n18.7\n181.0\n3750.0\nMALE\nNaN\nNaN\nNot enough blood for isotopes.\n\n\n1\nPAL0708\n2\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN1A2\nYes\n11/11/07\n39.5\n17.4\n186.0\n3800.0\nFEMALE\n8.94956\n-24.69454\nNaN\n\n\n2\nPAL0708\n3\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN2A1\nYes\n11/16/07\n40.3\n18.0\n195.0\n3250.0\nFEMALE\n8.36821\n-25.33302\nNaN\n\n\n3\nPAL0708\n4\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN2A2\nYes\n11/16/07\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nAdult not sampled.\n\n\n4\nPAL0708\n5\nAdelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)\nAnvers\nTorgersen\nAdult, 1 Egg Stage\nN3A1\nYes\n11/16/07\n36.7\n19.3\n193.0\n3450.0\nFEMALE\n8.76651\n-25.32426\nNaN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the data holds recorded measurements of Culmen length and depth, flipper length, and body mass, with indentifiers such as the study name, sample number, species, region, island, stage, individual id, clutch completion, egg date, and sex. In all, there 17 columns for each entry.\n\n\nVisualizing the Correlations in the Dataset\nLet’s try and find a correlation between measurements. Take flipper length and body mass. An interesting hypothesis would be that as flipper length increases, so does body mass. Let’s visualize this using a scatterplot. We’ll use seaborn and matplotlib along with the “penguins” dataframe we made earlier. The code is as follows:\n\nsns.scatterplot(data=penguins, x=\"Flipper Length (mm)\", y=\"Body Mass (g)\")\nplt.title(\"Penguin Flipper Length Affect On Body Mass\")\nplt.show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe take data from our penguins DataFrame, specifically from the “Flipper Length (mm)” and “Body Mass (g)” columns. We use seaborn as a shortcut to using matplotlib functions, like scatterplot as above. Pass penguins, “Flipper Length (mm),” and “Body Mass (g)” as arguments to sns.scatterplot. Choose a preferred title, and plot using plt.show. As a further modification, we can add a line of best fit by using sns.regplot, which autofits a line of regression. It’s produced as follows:\n\nsns.regplot(data=penguins, x=\"Flipper Length (mm)\", y=\"Body Mass (g)\", scatter_kws={\"color\":\"blue\"}, line_kws={\"color\":\"red\"})\nplt.title(\"Penguin Flipper Length Affect On Body Mass\")\nplt.show\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, scatter_kws and line_kws are both dictionaries that allow us to change the colors of the datapoints and line of best fit. Body mass and flipper length seem to be directly proportional. This makes sense, since the larger the flipper, the heavier it is, thus increasing body mass."
